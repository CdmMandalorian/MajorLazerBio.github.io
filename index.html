        <h2>Bio</h2>

        <br>

            <h3>Founder's Roots</h3>

                <p>A random white dude, born in Mississipi, raided outside of Ft. Lauderdale, Diplo (real name, Wes Pentz), had a huge diversified and culturally rich upbringing in Miami. While attending UFC, Wes becamea local school Disc Jockey, where he combined all his early influences with a mixture of Miami Bass.  Moving onto Temple Universityto continue his studies, all while teaching literature and math to kids with behavioral problems in an after scholol care program.  Gaining attention with a local peer DJ, the dou started making waves under the dou of Hollertronix.</p>

                <p>With an affinity of various musical taste, Diplo packed, and moved out to South America, primarly Brazil.  Taking a deep dive into the Favela music scene, Wes Pentz brought all of this back, with him to eventually form a partnership with Switch, an English Dj(songwriter, sound engineer, record producer) to form MAJOR LAZER.  With a mixture of both of their musical talents, they debuted Major Lazer's freshman album: "Guns Don't Kill People... Lazers Do!(2009). An Ep was also released by the group in 2010 named "Lazers Never Die". The incorporation of a hype man, is essential to any Major Lazer show.  Bringing forth Skerrit Bwoy, Major Lazer's first Hype-Man, performing alongside, Diplo and Switch at Coachella 2010. Shortly, after their debut Coachella performance, Switch departed from the group.  Stating, a "creative differences" factor.</p>

            <h3>Departures Bring Change</h3>

                <p>A year after in 2012, Skerrit Bwoy also departs from the group, in a pursue of a much richer religous life.  Both (Switch, Skerrit Bwoy) where replaced with the incorporation of Walshy Fire, and Jillionaire (2011).  Walshy Fire, with his Jamaican heritage, would drop forth Dancehall Reggae influences onto the DJ decks.  As Jillionaire being a Trinidadioan DJ and music producer, would bring his spice of unique mix of Indie dance, and Big Room House together with the Carribbean rhythms of Dancehall and Soca to reestablish Major Lazer.  By 2013 a new album was produced and released into the medium, "Free the Universe".  Once again garnering some national attention, via their lead single, "Get Free"; Major Lazer once again headline Coachella in 2013.  A year after, a new EP was dropped under the name of , "Apocalypse Now" (2014).  As EDM vastly gained attention, they delivered their newest album in 2015 "Peace is the Mission", Major Lazer was once again called upon to perform Coachella in 2016l  They where finally granted the Main Stage, in which they turn into a non-stop dance party through their performace.  </p>

            <h3>Bring On the Ape Drums</h3>

                <p>Lazer-forward a bit to 2019 and after making a couple of Eps, and performing word-wide with the group as Major Lazer, Jillionaire departs from the group to persue his solo artistic opportunities.  A new member is introduced, Ape Drums, an already well established American DJ and record producer.  his fusion of electronic dance musice with Carribean sounds, is usually dubbed as "Modern Dancehall music".  All this leading up to Major Lazer's latest studio album, "Lazerism" (2020). Together they have always brought the Mission, of Peace, Love, Freedom, Unity, through music.</p>
